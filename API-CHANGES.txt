Changes to make to API when we are ready to make backward incompatible changes:

- HTMLReport has special API for more context on columns and special handling in REportGenerator. Change all reports to the new API.
- DataContentViewer.isPreferred does not need isSupported to be passed in
- DataContentViewerHex and STrings can have the public setDataView methods removed in favor of the new private ones
