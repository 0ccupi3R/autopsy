Known issues and limitations

We plan to address the following issues in future releases.

General:
- Only a single instance of the application can be executed at once.  
There is no check if another instance is already running.  Running a second instance will cause issues.

Case:
- Closing a Case in certain situations when ingest is running or processing is being done in the background may cause stability issues.  
If case cannot be cleanly closed, try closing the application.

Ingest:
- Ingest may fail and cause unexpected behavior if "Add image" action is performed while ingest is running on previously added image.

Hash DB:
- Hash DB module does not currently search unallocated space and unallocated/deleted files,

Keyword search module:
- Keyword search module does not currently search unallocated space and unallocated/deleted files,
- Keyword search maximum size of files to be indexed and searched is 100MB,
- Keyword search maximum size of unknown files to be searched (using string extraction) is 1MB.
