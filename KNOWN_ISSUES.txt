Known issues and limitations

We plan to address the following issues in future releases.

General:
- Only a single instance of the application can be started at once.  
There is no check if another instance is already running.  Running a second instance will cause issues.
- Only a single case can be opened at a time.

Keyword search module:
- Keyword search module does not currently search unallocated space,
- Keyword search maximum size of files of known types to be indexed and searched is 100MB.  There is no limit on size of unknown file types indexed using string extraction.
