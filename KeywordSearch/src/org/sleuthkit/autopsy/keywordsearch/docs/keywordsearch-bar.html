        <p>
            The keyword search bar is used to search the index for matching words, phrases, lists, or regular expressions.
            It can also be used during ingest to add images to the search process.
            Enable regular expression mode by pressing the arrow to the left of the search box and selecting 'Use Regular Expressions'

        <h2>Keyword List Search</h2>
