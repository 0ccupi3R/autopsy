<h1>Setup</h1>

<p >Autopsy runs a Microsoft Windows computer. The Autopsy
installer will copy all needed files to the computer. </p>

<p >Before you ingest your first disk image, there are some
settings that you may want to configure. To make these configuration
changes, start Autopsy and then close the Welcome screen that prompts you to
create or open case by using the red &quot;X&quot; in the upper right. </p>

<h2>Keyword Search Lists</h2>

<p>Autopsy will automatically search for keywords in
pre-configured lists. You can create or import keyword lists in the Keyword
List Manager. You can open the Keyword List Manager from the &quot;Tools&quot;
menu. </p>

<p>To import a keyword list that was created from another
instance of Autopsy, use the &quot;Import List&quot; button and browse to the file. </p>

<p>To create a keyword list, use the &quot;New List&quot; button. Choose
a name for the list and then add keywords to it. It will be automatically
saved. Select &quot;Use during triage / ingest&quot; if you want this list to be
used automatically when an image is added. </p>

<h2>Hash Sets</h2>

<p>Autopsy will automatically search for files with hash values
that match those that are in databases. You can import hash databases into Autopsy
using the Hash Database Manager. You can open it from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu. </p>

<p><span><img width=254 height=218 src="hashdb_config.png"></span></p>

<p>You can use the NIST NSRL to ignore known files. If
you were provided with a large file named NSRLComplete.txt-md5.idx, then browse
to that file in the NIST NSRL section in the top part of the window. </p>

<p>You can import EnCase hashsets to flag known bad
files. Browse to the EnCase hashset file in the Known Bad Hashset section
of the window. You may need to make an index of this file before you can use it
by pressing the &quot;Index&quot; button. In the future, you can copy the .idx index
file along with the EnCase hashset to other Autopsy installations and avoid
having to re-index the database. </p>

<h1>Adding a Disk Image</h1>

<p>Disk images are added to a case. A case could have a single
image or it could have all of the images from an objective. Currently, a single
report is generated for an entire case, so if you need to report on individual
images, then you should use one image per case. </p>

<h2>Creating a Case</h2>

<p>To create a case, use either the &quot;Create New Case&quot; option on
the Welcome screen or from the &quot;File&quot; menu. This will start the New Case
wizard. You will need to supply it with the name of the case and a
directory to store the case results into. You can optionally provide case
numbers and other details. </p>

<h2>Adding an Image</h2>

<p>The next step is to add a disk image to the case. The
&quot;Add Image Wizard&quot; will start automatically after the case is created or you
can manually start it from the &quot;File&quot; menu or toolbar. You will need to
supply it with the location of the disk image to add. Autopsy currently
supports E01 and raw (dd) files. </p>

<p>It may take a few minutes to add the disk image.
During this time, a database is being created of the file system contents. </p>

<h2>Ingest Modules</h2>

<p>You will next be prompted to configure the Ingest Modules. Ingest
modules will run in the background and perform specific tasks. </p>

<ul>
<li>Recent Activity extracts user activity as saved by web browsers and the OS.</li>
<li>Hash Lookup uses hash databases to ignore known files and flag notable files.</li>
<li>Keyword Search uses Keyword Lists to identify files with specific words in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also choose the update frequency. This setting
configures how often you will get updates from the ingest modules when they are
running in the background. The more frequent the updates, the longer the
overall process will take. </p>

<p>While modules are running in the background, you will see a progress
bar in the lower right. </p>

<h1>Analysis Basics</h1>

<p>SCREEN SHOT HERE</p>



<p>You will start all of your analysis techniques from the tree
on the left. </p>

<ul>
<li>The
Images node shows the file system structure of the disk images.</li>

<li>The
Views node shows the same data from a file type or timeline perspective.</li>

<li>The
Results node shows the output from the ingest modules.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you select a node from the tree on the left, a list of
files will be shown in the upper right. You can use the Thumbnail view in
the upper right to view the pictures. When you select a file from the
upper right, its contents will be shown in the lower right. You can use
the tabs in the lower right to view the text of the file, an image, or the hex
data.</p>

<p>If you are viewing files from the Views and Results nodes,
you can right click on a file to go to its file system location. This
feature is useful to see what else the user stored in the same folder as the
file that you are currently looking at. You can also right click on a
file to extract it to the local system.</p>

<p>If you want to search for single keywords, then you can use
the search box in the upper right of the program. The results will be
shown in a table in the upper right. </p>

<h2>Ingest Inbox</h2>

<p>As you are going through the results in the tree, the ingest
modules are running in the background. The results are shown in the tree
based on the update frequency selected when the image was added to the case. </p>

<p>The Ingest Inbox receives messages from the ingest modules
as they find results. You can open the inbox to see what has been recently
found. It keeps track of what messages you have read. </p>

<p>The intended use of this inbox is that you can focus on some
data for a while and then check back on the inbox at a time that is convenient
for them. You can then see what else was found while you were focused on
the previous task. You may learn that a notable file was found or that a file
was found with a relevant keyword and then decide to focus on that for a while.
</p>

<p>When you select a message, you can then jump to the Results
tree where more details can be found or jump to the file's location in the file
system.</p>

<h1>Example Use Cases</h1>

<p>In this section, we will provide examples of how to do
common analysis tasks. </p>

<h2>Web Artifacts</h2>

<p>If you want to view the user's recent web activity, make
sure that the Recent Activity ingest module was enabled. You can then go
to the &quot;Results &quot; node in the tree on the left and then into the &quot;Extracted
Data&quot; node. There, you can find bookmarks, cookies, downloads, and
history. </p>

<h2>Notable Hash Files</h2>

<p>If you want to see if the image had known bad files, make
sure that the Hash Lookup ingest module was enabled. You can then view
the &quot;Hashset Hits&quot; section in the &quot;Results&quot; area of the tree on the left. Note
that hash lookup can take a long time, so this section will be updated as long
as the ingest process is occurring. Use the Ingest Inbox to keep track of
what notable files were recently found. </p>

<p>When you find a notable file in this interface, you may want
to right click on the file to also view the file's original location. You
may find additional files that are relevant and stored in the same folder as
this file. </p>

<h2>Images and Videos</h2>

<p>If you want to see all images and video on the disk image,
then go to the &quot;Views&quot; section in the tree on the left and then &quot;File
Types&quot;. Select either &quot;Images&quot; or &quot;Videos&quot;. You can use the
thumbnail option in the upper right to view thumbnails of all images.</p>

<p>NOTE: We are working on making this more efficient when there
are lots of images and we are working on the feature to display video
thumbnails.</p>

<p>You can select an image or video from the upper right and
view the video or image in the lower right. Video will be played with sound. </p>

<h1>Reporting</h1>

<p>A final report can be generated that will include all
analysis results. Use the &quot;Generate Report&quot; button to create this. It will
create an HTML or XLS report in the Reports folder of the case folder. If you
forgot the location of your case folder, you can determine it using the &quot;Case
Properties&quot; option in the &quot;File&quot; menu. </p>
