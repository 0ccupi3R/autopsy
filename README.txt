OVERVIEW

Autopsy is a graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit and other open source digital forensics tools. Autopsy 3 is a complete rewrite from Autopsy 2 and it is now Java-based.  This version is currently in a beta state.   

The current beta version works only on Windows.  We have run it on XP, Vista, and Windows 7 with no problems. 

Autopsy 3.0 is relased under the Apache 2.0 license. 


INSTALLATION

Autopsy requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed. A 32-bit version of release 1.6+ is required. If you have a 64-bit version of the JRE, then it will fail. We are working on a 64-bit version for a later release.

You can download Java from here:

You should be able to simply open the Autopsy ZIP file and run the autopsy.exe program located in the 'bin' folder.
