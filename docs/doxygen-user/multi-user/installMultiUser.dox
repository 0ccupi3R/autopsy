\section multiuser_install_overview Overview

Autopsy can be setup to work in an environment where multiple users on different computers can have the same case open at the same time.  To set up this type of environment, you will need to configure additional (free and open source) network-based services.  

The basic concept is that you'll have a central:
- Database 
- Keyword search index
- Storage

Each Autopsy client will then use those shared resources instead of the embedded versions that are used for single-user cases.
